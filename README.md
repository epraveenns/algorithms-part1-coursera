# Algorithms-Part1--Assignments
These are my programming assignments to the course Algorithms, Part I by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick of the Princeton University. 

This course is available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/ and I would highly recommend it to all Java programmers.

I received the following grades by submitting these programs

Assignment 1 - Percolation - 91%

Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Queues - 81%

Assignment 3 - Collinear Points - 97%

Assignment 4 - 8 Puzzle - 90%

Assignment 5 - Kd trees - 85%


Although taking help is not wrong, I suggest you to try as much as you can before looking into these solutions.
